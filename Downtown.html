                        <p class="lead; font-size: 30 px">Romeo, Michigan is a small, rural town in southeast Michigan, about 40 miles north of Detroit with a population of 3,767 as of 2020 (Data Commons n.d.). Originally named “Indian Village” because of the Anishinaabeg who inhabited the area, it was later named Hoxie’s Settlement in the 1820s and 1830s when New Englanders, upstate New Yorkers, as well as Canadian, Irish, English, and Scottish immigrants settled there. It received this name after Mr. Hoxie opened an Inn on main street. Many settlers came to become merchants and business owners by farming, lumbering, and trading. It was later named Romeo in the spring of 1830 when Mr. Nathaniel T. Taylor’s (first merchant) wife suggested the name as “it was short, musical, classical and uncommon” (Daugherty 1970). In the 1850s, Romeo rivaled Mt. Clemens as a leading trading center. Other businesses included “a hoop-skirt factory, a broom factory, a chair factory, an iron foundry, a cigar factory, a sash and blind factory,” and four separate carriage manufacturing companies “one with patronage as far west as California” (Daugherty 1970). Residents of Romeo were also involved in nineteenth and twentieth-century reform as the town was a station in the Underground Railroad, engaged in prohibition efforts, and welcomed leading suffragettes to visit and discuss women’s rights. When the railroad came in 1869, business owners and merchants were able to travel to New York and Cleveland, and even Philadelphia and Chicago to attend world fairs, and many of the wealthier families had summer homes in the southern United States. In the early 1900s when Ford was having problems getting engine parts in Detroit, Romeo foundry answered the call, and in 1908, it began making engine blocks for Ford’s new Model T (The Historical Marker Database 2023b). In 1970, Romeo Historic District was awarded the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site.</p>
                        <p class="lead; font-size: 30 px">Romeo’s successes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to its popularity socially as well. With many businesses growing and changing along main street, tourism and travel was common early on. Romeo has also attracted many tourists since its founding because of its businesses and social events. Today, many come to Romeo in the fall for its annual Peach Festival and Terror on Tilson events. The Romeo Peach Festival began in 1931 when then village President, Edward E. Jacob, and local farmers wanted to promote economic growth for the town. It soon evolved into a large festival, complete with activities, parades, shows, and even the annual Romeo Peach Festival Queen Pageant (Record Newspapers, LLC 2022). Terror on Tilson is growing in popularity as well. What started out as a few houses decorating their houses and yards for Halloween, has grown into many houses being part of a two-block spectacle (Michigan Economic Development Corporation 2023). Tens of thousands of people come to Romeo for events such as these, which shows how the community is trying to preserve its downtown charm and history.</p>
